	<p1> <p1 style="font-size:56px">N</p1>ewton's second law of motion states that there is a proportion between net force acting on an object and the object's acceleration.
	The coefficient of proportionality is the objects mass, the equation is as follows:</p1>
	<h2>ΣF=ma</h2>
	<p1>ΣF - the sum of all forces acting on the body</p1> <br>
	<p1>a - the object's acceleration</p1><br>
	<p1>m - the object's mass</p1><br><br>
	<p1>For example: If I'm pushing a body with a mass of 2kg with a force of 10N((read out as 10 Newtons) the body's acceleration would then be 5m/s^2. the
	ball will start accelerating, it's velocity will increase by 5m/s every second.	</p1><br><br>
	
	<p1><p1 style="font-size:56px">F</p1>rom newton's 2nd law we can conclude that if ΣF=0 then a=0 and if a=0 the ΣF=0. this is called Newton's first law of motion.
	In other words, if all forces acting on a body cancel out then the body doesn't change is velocity and vice versa.</p1><br>
	<p1> For example, if I push a ball with a force of 5N And there is wind blowing in the opposite direction, also applying a force of 5N
	then the ball will simply not move. But, If the wind were to start blowing before I push the balloon and the wind gives It an initial velocity and only then I
	start pushing the baloon, the baloon will remain in the same initial velocity. let's plug the values in the equation and confirm it. ΣF =5N-5N=0=ma, thus a=0
	and the velocity doesn't change.
