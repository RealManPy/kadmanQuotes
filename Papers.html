	<b><u>Newton's second law</u> of motion states that there is a proportion between net force acting on an object and the object's acceleration.
	The coefficient of proportionality is the objects mass, the equation is as follows:</b><br>
	<h2>ΣF=ma</h2><br>
	<b>ΣF - the sum of all forces acting on the body</b><br>
	<b>a - the object's acceleration</b><br>
	<b>m - the object's mass</b><br><br>
	<b>For example: If I'm pushing a body with a mass of 2kg with a force of 10N((read out as 10 Newtons) the body's acceleration would then be 5m/s^2. the
	ball will start accelerating, it's velocity will increase by 5m/s every second.	</b><br><br>
	
	<b>From newton's 2nd law we can conclude that if ΣF=0 then a=0 and if a=0 the ΣF=0. this is called <u>Newton's first law</u> of motion.
	In other words, if all forces acting on a body cancel out then the body doesn't change is velocity and vice versa.</b>
	<b> For example, if I push a ball with a force of 5N And there is wind blowing in the opposite direction, also applying a force of 5N
	then the ball will simply not move. But, If the wind were to start blowing before I push the balloon and the wind gives It an initial velocity and only then I
	start pushing the baloon, the baloon will remain in the same initial velocity. let's plug the values in the equation and confirm it. ΣF =5N-5N=0=ma, therefor a=0
	and the velocity doesn't change.</b><br><br>
	
	<b> For Newton's third law consider this thought experiment: your hand is pushing a table, thus making the table accelerate. Your hand is also accelerating
	with the table and they are moving at equal speeds. <strong>Relative</strong> to the hand, the table is not moving, thus a<b style="font-size:20">table</b>=0(Relative to the hand).
	According to Newton's first law ΣF<b style="font-size:20">table</b>=0. If the hand is applying a force F to the table then there has to be a force of magnitude F and 
	an opposite direction to F such that: ΣF<b style="font-size:20">table</b>=F+(-F)=0.</b><br><br>
	
	<b>We conclude from here <u>Newton's third law</u> which states all that when a force is apllied on a body the body will apply an opposite force with the
	same magnitude.</b>
